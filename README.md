# hello-world
The very first show..
I'm a cardiovascular surgeon and data scientist from Taiwan with creative and ambitious minds, hoping to change the world and to be influential.  When young, I finished my med school in Taiwan and studied a master degree from Harvard U, USA, major in epidemiology.  My residency of cardiovascular surgery was done in Taiwan and then two clinical fellowships in Emory and Indiana Univ.  Now I have my green card and wish to immigrate to USA with a great career!
